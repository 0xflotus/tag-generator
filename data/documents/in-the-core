Why’s it always in the core?
For the freedom of a bore
That tore the system apart
Making everyone the slaves.
It had to be with the sodomized rules
That governed the entire pulse
Unwillingly seeding into the breath
Why is it just in the core?
Why? everyone wonders
The vicinity of the enslaved
Why, why in the core?
They f**ked with ur mind
They hanged your neck
They took your breath
Now, they are resurrecting your death
WHY?
They made the system, Framed the majority
Now they are puppeting…
They are who they are
In this age of dark terror
Why’s it always in the core?
They led the truth of lies into the dead
The resurrection has been fed
So, now what?
The silence of the answer remains..
Why???
They f**ked with the your mind
They hanged your neck
They took your breath
Now, they are resurrecting your death
Why??
Now, just go on and live the death of life
Be ressurrected and be cursed
